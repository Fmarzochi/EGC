## EGC Auto-Intuition

Act on user intent, not keywords. When what the user says implies an EGC action, call the right tool immediately -- no explicit command needed.

- Session ending (goodbye, break, sleep, done, closing) → call `update_state`
- Session starting or resuming → call `get_state`
- Save/remember this decision → call `lesson_save` or `store_decision`
- What failed? What did we decide? → call `search_history` or `query_history`
- Review code or a PR → spawn `/review-pr` agents
- Context is heavy or slow → call `reduce_context`

Judge by the full conversation context, never by literal words. A remark to someone nearby is not a command. When intent is ambiguous, keep working.
